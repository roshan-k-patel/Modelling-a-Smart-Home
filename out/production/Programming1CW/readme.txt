\b \cf0 PLEASE USE THE CONFIG FILE THAT I HAVE INCLUDED AS I HAVE EDITED IT TO DEMONSTRATE MY EXTENSION

\b Extension
\b0 : For my extension i created a gas tank which extends the Meter class. The gas tank is represented by a percentage of fullness and is initialised at 100% full. I added a cooker appliance to the config file to demonstrate it\'92s usage. When the cooker is used by the simulation the GasTank will report what percentage of gas was used. \
\
It will then report what percentage is remaining in the tank. Then the gas tank is automatically refilled through a modern industrial pipe into the tank. So whenever the gas tank is not full it automatically refills itself. \
\
I overloaded the constructor for house to reflect the new meter. The simulation submitted includes a gas appliance, so if you want to run it without any gas appliances then just remove the gas appliance from the config file}
